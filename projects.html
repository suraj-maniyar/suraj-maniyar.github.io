     <p>
This project was aimed at recommending solutions to users investing in stock market by utilizing fundamental and technical analyses. The best companies to invest in was chosen using fundamental analysis and the user's portfolio was optimized to distribute the investment in different stocks to maximize returns and reduce risks. Technical analysis was implemented separately using Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning to suggest actions (buy, sell or hold) to the user to maximize his/her portfolio.

     </h3>
     <p>
This project was focused on estimating the respiratory rate of an individual using accelerometer data, heart rate and body temperature. 3 different models were implemented separately for estimation: Ridge Regression, Neural Networks and Hidden Markov Model.
